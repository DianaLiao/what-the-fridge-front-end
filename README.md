# What the Fridge?
This is an inventory management app for your refrigerator! Log food as you buy them, with purchase date and expiration date. You may use the built-in search function linked to the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) to add images. 

This was a phase 3 group project for Flatiron School, made with [@MelSwell](https://github.com/MelSwell). The frontend is written in plain JavaScript, using a Rails API on the backend.
